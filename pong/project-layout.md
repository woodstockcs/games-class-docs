# Project Layout

## Purpose

## Examples

## Exercises

1. Look at the [starter code](). What's wrong with putting the paddle at (0,0)? Where would be a better position for the left paddle in Pong?

2. Our paddle is 20 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. Would these be good dimensions for a Pong paddle? Why or why not?

3. Improve the starter code by:

   - Moving the paddle to a better position
   - Adjusting the size if needed
   - Adding a clear comment that explains what each number does

4. CHALLENGE: The right paddle in Pong is a mirror of the left paddle. How would you change the starter code to draw the right paddle instead? (Hint: the game screen is 400 pixels wide)
