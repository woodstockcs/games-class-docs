# Paddles

## Purpose

Learn how basic shapes are drawn on a computer screen.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

- aaa
- bbb

## Warmup

1. On a 100x100 coordinate grid, what are the coordinates of some points near the edge?
2. Fill in the blanks: A rectangle needs ** and ** to describe its size.
3. True or False: On the p5js coordinate grid, the point (0,0) is in the upper-left.

## Problem

Our Pong game needs paddles.

## Ideas

Here are some beginning attempts at drawing a paddle from students who are just starting to learn p5.js:

```javascript
// Maria's idea:
paddle(left, tall)

// Jackson's idea:
rectangle = [50 pixels, 200 pixels]
putOnScreen(rectangle)

// Devon's idea:
draw rectangle x=20 y=100 width=10 height=60
```

... or watch the video on youtube ([0:00 - 10:46 at this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3TeLi6Ns1E)) and answer these questions on a sheet of paper:

- What are two other words that mean "instruction" in programming?
- What is the area where you draw called?
- In your own words - what is an argument to a function?
- Daniel says that learning to program is not just learning to code, but is also ...
- What is the difference between setup() and draw(), according to the video?
- Write a 1-3 sentence summary of the video.

## Essential Knowledge

1.  A canvas is a drawing area with specified width and height in pixels.
1.  Functions are instructions that tell a computer what to do.
1.  Function syntax requires the function name followed by parentheses containing arguments.
1.  Arguments are values that modify function execution and must be ordered and comma-separated.
1.  Functions require varying numbers of arguments ranging from zero to many.
1.  Documentation shows programmers how to use functions and their arguments.
