# Mouse Variables

## Sandbox

Open and duplicate [this sandbox sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/woodstock-cs/sketches/0B_2WK4j8/).

What happens when you ...
1. run the code?
2. change `background(0)` to `background(mouseX)`?
3. remove the `background(...)` line from `draw()` ?
4. add `background(0)` to `setup()`?
5. change that new `background(0)` to `background(mouseX)`?
6. change that to `background(mouseX, 100, 100)`?
7. change that to `background(mouseX, mouseY, 100)`?

Think about ...
1. Why do we need both setup() and draw()?
2. What might happen if we remove background() entirely?
3. How does the computer know where the mouse is?
