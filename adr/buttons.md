# Purpose

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Learning:</th>
    <td style="width:100%">understand boolean expressions and event handlers</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Making ADR:</th>
    <td style="width:100%">create interactive buttons that respond to game state</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br><br>

# Sandbox

1. Open the [Buttons Distro Code](https://editor.p5js.org/woodstock-cs/sketches/TEzeoGPC7).
2. Run it and try these experiments.
   - Click each button several times
   - Wait for buttons to re-enable (watch the sweep animation)
   - Let your wood run out
   - Try clicking disabled buttons
   - Change the initial wood value in setup() to 1, then 20
   - Change the refresh time (last number) in addButton()

> Write in your sprint notes:
>
> - What makes buttons become disabled?
> - How long does each button take to refresh?
> - When do messages appear in the panel?

# Exercises

### Get Wood
{: .d-inline-block}
Approaching
{: .label .label-green }

1. Duplicate this [Buttons Distro Code](https://editor.p5js.org/woodstock-cs/sketches/TEzeoGPC7).
2. Make these small changes to test your understanding:
   - Change the initial `wood` value in setup to 100
   - Update the "get wood" button to give 2 wood
   - Change the "fire is burning" message to something else
   - Move the "get wood" button down by changing its y-position

{: .note-title}

> Before continuing:
>
> Rename the sketch `Get Wood` and save it.
>
> Then write that name in your sprint notes.

### New Theme
{: .d-inline-block}
Proficient
{: .label .label-blue }

1. Duplicate your `Get Wood` sketch.
2. Pick a theme (space station, kitchen, garden, etc.)
3. Update the code to match your theme:
   - Rename the variables (e.g., 'oxygen' instead of 'wood')
   - Change button labels to fit your theme
   - Update the messages in addToPanel()
   - Change button positions if needed

Example themes:

- Space: oxygen/fuel, "refill tanks"/"check systems"
- Kitchen: ingredients/heat, "add ingredients"/"adjust temperature"
- Garden: water/seeds, "water plants"/"plant seeds"

{: .note-title}

> Before continuing:
>
> Rename the sketch `New Theme` and save it.
>
> Then write that name in your sprint notes.

### New Button
{: .d-inline-block}
Distinguished
{: .label .label-red }

1. Duplicate your `New Theme` sketch.
2. Add one new button that:
   - Has a different refresh time
   - Affects your resources in a new way
   - Shows themed messages
   - Gets disabled under certain conditions
3. Add a new resource variable that fits your theme
4. Update the `draw()` function to check your new conditions

Example features:

- Space: radiation levels affect oxygen consumption
- Kitchen: temperature affects ingredient quality
- Garden: seasons change resource availability
